# Morse_Communication

This project provides a simulation of the morse encoding scheme using the BPSK modulation scheme, under the condition of complex AWGN\(Additive White Gaussian Noise)

The prior probabilities are calculated by encoding a large body of text into morse and counting the resulting 1s and 0s
